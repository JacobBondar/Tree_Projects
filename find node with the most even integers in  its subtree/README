Find the subtree, even greater than odd.
================================================

This code implements a binary search tree where nodes store integers.
It aims to find and print the node with the most even integers in 
its subtree. A recursive function counts even and odd numbers in each
subtree to identify the node with the highest count of even integers.
If no suitable node is found, it outputs "NOT FOUND".

Input: User input sequence of integers as input to build a binary
	  search tree.

Output: The integer value stored in the node with the most even 
	  integers in its subtree, or "NOT FOUND" if no such node exists.
