Find the subtree with the same coordinates.
===============================================

This program utilizes a binary search tree structure (Node) to store
integer IDs and corresponding coordinates (Point). It aims to find 
and print the node whose subtree best meets specified geometric 
criteria based on its coordinates' quadrant placement.

Input: User input consists of integer IDs followed by their
	  coordinates.

Output: The coordinates of the node with the largest subtree 
	satisfying the quadrant conditions, or "00" if no such node is found.

RunTime: o(n^2) when "n" represents the amount of nodes we have in
the tree. We are talking about the overall run time of the code,
so to build the tree, in the worst time (when the tree is skewed),
we will have to run 1 + 2 + ... + n times, which is n^2.
